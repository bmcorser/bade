You should get a grip of bade by running through here, if you want to know
more, refer to the :ref:`Documentation`.

Pages
=====

Pages are rST documents that will be rendered but not included in the
":ref:`Blogtree`". They are expected to be in a directory called ``pages`` in
the same directory where ``bade`` is invoked, but this can be configured (see
`Config`_ below).

Let's make a ``pages`` directory and put a page there.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkir pages
    touch pages/about.rst

And throw some rST in that file.

.. code-block:: rst
